# PTSD-terminology
Toward the PTSD Ontology

The PTSD Ontology is being developed in order to improve the understanding of PTSD. It is currently a taxonomy directed toward the two following categories:

1) Symptomatology characteristics
    a. signs and symptoms
    b. emotions
    c. behaviors
    d. mental or behavioral dysfunctions
    e. clinical findings
2) Therapeutic interventions
    a. therapeutic or preventive procedures
    b. mental processes
    c. educational activities
    d. pharmacologic substances
    e. individual behaviors

IDs are reused from the Disease Ontology as far as is possible. It is developed in the context of the Ontology for General Medical Science and the Basic Formal Ontology. A goal is to make assumptions of the disorder explicit and reduce the ambiguity in concepts that describe symptoms and treatments in its domain. The primary objective for its implementation is to support the development of text processing pipelines for information extraction in biomedical text and clinical progress notes.
